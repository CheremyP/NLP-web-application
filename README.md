# Linguify
Linguify s an open-source React web application written in Javascript, and Flask back end.

### Installation

You’ll need to have Node 10.16.0 or later version on your local development machine (but it’s not required on the server). I recommend using the latest LTS version.

In addtion you'll need open ai whisper and rapid api key. The installation process for 
open can be found [here] (https://github.com/openai/whisper) and the rapid api you will need an account for which you can sign up [here] (https://rapidapi.com/).
